## 2026-06-03 — Repo bootstrap

### Step 1 — Bootstrap project

- Created `package.json` (ESM, Node 20+, pnpm). Added `"packageManager": "pnpm@9.12.0"` (not in the
  original spec) so Corepack resolves a deterministic pnpm version in CI/Render/local.
- `tsconfig.json` is typecheck/IDE only: `noEmit: true`, no `rootDir` (the spec put `rootDir: ./src`
  on a config that also `include`s `tests/` + `scripts/`, which errors with TS6059). Emit lives in
  `tsconfig.build.json` (`rootDir: ./src`, src only).
- **Import convention:** relative imports with explicit `.js` extensions, no `@/*` alias usage. This
  is the only convention that runs unchanged under `tsx`, Vitest, and `node dist` without a
  path-rewrite build step. The `@/*` path is kept in tsconfig (per spec) but intentionally unused.
- ESLint via legacy `.eslintrc.cjs` (ESLint 8). `no-explicit-any: error` in `src/`, relaxed in
  `tests/` + `scripts/`. Not using type-aware linting (no `parserOptions.project`) to keep lint fast
  and decoupled from include globs.
- Added `vitest.config.ts` (not in spec tree) — needed so Vitest resolves `.js`→`.ts` and for
  coverage config.
- `docker-compose.yml` uses `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` so the `vector` extension is available locally;
  `redis:7-alpine` for the queue.
- Multi-stage `Dockerfile` (build → prod-deps runtime), `render.yaml` per spec (web + worker + redis
  + managed Postgres 16).

### Environment notes (this machine)

- Node v24.13.0, npm 11.6.2. `pnpm` not installed globally and Corepack cannot symlink into
  `/usr/local/bin` (EACCES) — pnpm is therefore invoked as `corepack pnpm`.
- `docker` not installed locally → compose stack cannot be brought up here; files are authored and
  validated by inspection. Same for live Postgres/Redis/OpenAI: code is written and unit-tested with
  mocks; anything requiring live services is called out in the relevant step.

### Step 2 — Docker compose (21:15)

- `docker-compose.yml`: `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` + `redis:7-alpine`, both with healthchecks;
  `enable-pgvector.sql` mounted as a Postgres init script. Docker isn't installed on this machine,
  so the stack was authored + reviewed but not booted here.

### Step 3 — Drizzle schema (21:25)

- 8 tables: tenants, users, conversations, messages, tool_calls, knowledge_docs, knowledge_chunks,
  audit_log. `knowledge_chunks.embedding` is `vector(1536)` with an HNSW cosine index.
- **No DB-level foreign keys.** Isolation is repo-layer (per spec). drizzle-kit 0.24 can't resolve
  ESM `.js` specifiers to `.ts`, so schema files avoid value-level sibling imports; `drizzle.config`
  lists the 8 table files explicitly (not the barrel). First migration `0000_*.sql` generated, then
  `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;` prepended so `db:migrate` is self-sufficient.

### Step 4 — Repos (21:35)

- `userRepo`, `conversationRepo`, `messageRepo`, `knowledgeRepo`, `auditRepo`, `toolCallRepo` (+
  `util`). Every method scopes by `ctx.tenantId` (conversations also by `userId`).
  `knowledgeRepo.buildSearchQuery` is exposed so the RBAC test can assert the tenant/audience WHERE
  via `.toSQL()` offline.

### Step 5 — Auth (21:45)

- `permissions.ts` holds the literal role→{scopes,audiences} table. **Scopes are always derived from
  role server-side** (never read from the JWT) so a tampered token can't escalate. `jose` HS256
  access/refresh tokens; bcrypt + pepper for passwords; constant-time-ish login.

### Step 6 — Fastify plugins (21:50)

- requestContext (AsyncLocalStorage + requestId), errorHandler (AppError/Zod → JSON), auth
  (`app.authenticate`), rbac (`requireRole`/`requireScope`/`requireAudience`), healthcheck
  (`/health`). Applied on the root instance so decorators propagate without `fastify-plugin`.

### Step 7 — Tool framework (22:00)

- `ToolManifest` contract + type-erased `RegisteredTool`; `registerTool` validates input→handler→
  output with no casts. `ToolRegistry.checkAccess` is the single RBAC gate (audience + all scopes +
  write-risk→admin). 8 definitions: `knowledge.search` is real (retriever); the other 7 are typed
  stubs returning deterministic mock data keyed to `ctx.tenantId`. OpenAI function names can't
  contain dots, so the chat layer maps `.`↔`__`.

### Step 8 — OpenAI chat loop (22:00)

- `chatService.runChatTurn` + `streamChatTurn` (SSE with tool-call delta assembly), bounded by
  `MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS`. Tools dispatch only through `toolDispatcher` (re-checks RBAC, persists a
  tool_calls row + audit). `costTracker` rolls up tokens×price per tenant. messageStore converts
  rows↔OpenAI messages and trims orphan leading tool messages.

### Step 9 — Knowledge ingestion (22:05)

- `chunker` (recursive char splitter, overlap), `embedder` (text-embedding-3-small, dim-checked),
  `ingestService` (checksum-idempotent: chunk→embed→atomic replaceChunks), `retriever` (kNN via
  repo), `ingestWorker` (BullMQ; connection passed as RedisOptions to dodge an ioredis version skew
  with BullMQ's bundled copy). The HTTP `/knowledge/embed` ingests synchronously so it works without
  Redis; the worker is for async/bulk.

### Step 10 — Remaining tools + routes (22:05)

- The 7 vendor tool stubs (Zoho ×2, Octane ×3, partner ×2) plus routes (auth, chat, knowledge,
  tools, admin, health), `app.ts` factory, and `server.ts`. Scripts: `seed` (octane tenant + admin
  + sample users), programmatic `migrate`, `embed-docs` CLI. CI (lint/typecheck/test/build) +
  deploy (Render hook).

### Verification (22:10)

- `pnpm typecheck` clean · `pnpm lint` clean · `pnpm test` 25/25 (incl. the cross-tenant RBAC test)
  · `pnpm build` clean · `dist/app.js` loads under Node ESM (confirms `.js`-extension prod runtime)
  · `pnpm db:generate` reports no drift · largest file 326 lines (< 600 cap).
- Not runnable here (no docker/Postgres/Redis/OpenAI key): `db:migrate`, `db:seed`, live
  `/v1/chat` round trip, `/v1/knowledge/embed` persistence. Code is complete; these need live
  services (run `docker compose up -d` + set `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
