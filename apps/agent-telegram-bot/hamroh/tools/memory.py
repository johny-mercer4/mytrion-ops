"""Memory tools — read, list, write, append.

This module is the **only** place in ``hamroh/tools/`` allowed to touch
the filesystem (security invariant 5). All four tools route through
:class:`hamroh.storage.memory_store.MemoryStore`, which enforces:

- path traversal protection (no ``..``, no absolute paths, no symlinks)
- 64 KiB per-file cap
- read-before-write for any file that already exists

There is intentionally no ``delete_memory`` tool. If the agent wants to
"forget" something it has to overwrite it; actually removing files
remains an operator-only action.
