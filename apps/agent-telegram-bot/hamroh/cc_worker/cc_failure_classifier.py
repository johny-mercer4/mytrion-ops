"""Classify CC-side failure signals into user-facing messages.

Data-driven: add a new failure mode by appending a :class:`CcFailurePattern`
to :data:`CC_FAILURE_PATTERNS`. Detectors in :mod:`hamroh.engine` and the
``_on_cc_crash`` hook in ``__main__.py`` both consume the classifier so there
is one authoritative mapping from "CC diagnostic text" to "what the user
sees", instead of scattered substring checks across the control loop.

Matches are case-insensitive and substring-based. Patterns are checked in
order and the first match wins, so place more-specific patterns before
generic ones.
