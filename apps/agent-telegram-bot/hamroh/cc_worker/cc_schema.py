#: Hard cap on ``reason``. At ~4 chars/token that's ~25 tokens worst case;
#: paired with the system-prompt nudge ("≤10 words, terse") a well-behaved
#: turn costs far less. Without a cap a single rambling justification can
#: burn 100+ tokens — cheap per turn, expensive over a long session.
REASON_MAX_LENGTH = 100

#: The Anthropic API's tool ``input_schema`` rejects top-level ``oneOf``,
#: ``allOf``, and ``anyOf`` (and likely ``if``/``then``). That means we
#: can't express "reason is required only on stop" in the schema itself
#: — this must stay a flat object. The "required on stop" invariant is
#: instead enforced client-side by :class:`~hamroh.models.ControlAction`'s
#: ``@model_validator`` when the stream-json event is parsed.
