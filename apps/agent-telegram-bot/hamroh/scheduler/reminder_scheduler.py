"""Reminder scheduler — the background loop that fires due reminders.

Polls the ``reminders`` table every 60s and injects each due reminder into
the engine as a synthetic message. Persistence lives in
:mod:`hamroh.db.reminders` and the agent-facing tools in
:mod:`hamroh.tools.reminder`; this module is the runtime glue between
them — claim a due reminder, inject it, and on the engine's success/failure
hook advance/close it or revert the claim (#22, #44, #48).
