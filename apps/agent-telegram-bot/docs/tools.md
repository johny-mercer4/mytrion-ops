# Tools reference

This is the canonical list of every tool available to the bot, organised
by what's on by default and what's opt-in. Each opt-in section names the
env var(s) that flip the gate.

For Claude Code's full upstream tool catalogue (some of which hamroh
doesn't currently expose) see
<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference>. The
"Other CC tools you can wire in" section at the bottom of this page
points at the ones a fork might want to add.

---

## Always on — hamroh built-ins

These are the bot's core surface, served by the local hamroh MCP
server. Auto-discovered from `hamroh/tools/*.py` (each tool is a
`BaseTool` subclass). All available every turn; no env flag needed.

### Messaging

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `telegram_send_message` | Send a text message to a chat. **The only way the user sees anything** — a plain text content block produces no Telegram output. |
| `telegram_reply_to_message` | Reply to a specific user message (threads in groups). |
| `telegram_edit_message` | Edit one of the bot's previous messages. No push notification — good for in-progress updates on long tasks. |
| `telegram_delete_message` | Delete a bot message. Use sparingly. |
| `telegram_add_reaction` | React to a message with an emoji. Prefer over "ok"/"👍" replies in groups. |
| `telegram_create_poll` | Send a poll. Supports regular/quiz, multi-answer, anonymity toggle, auto-close (`open_period` or `close_date`), and reply-to. |
| `telegram_stop_poll` | Close a live poll early and return final tallies. |
| `telegram_read_attachment` | Read a photo or document the user sent. The dispatcher saves inbound attachments under `data/attachments/` and surfaces them as `[attachment: <path> ...]` markers — pass that path here. Images come back as image content blocks (you actually see them); text-like files (md/txt/log/csv/json/yaml/code) come back as UTF-8; PDFs are extracted via `pypdf` and returned as text with `--- page N ---` markers. Path traversal is rejected. GIFs/videos are unsupported. |
| `telegram_send_memory_document` | Send a memory file (under `memories/`) to a chat as a downloadable document. Path-locked to the memory root. Optional caption + reply-to. |
| `render_html` | Render an HTML snippet to PNG via headless Chromium → `data/renders/`. Use for tables/charts/diffs that markdown can't fit. Network blocked — inline any CSS/JS. Returns the relative path. |
| `render_latex` | Render a LaTeX expression to PNG via KaTeX (loaded from `cdn.jsdelivr.net` only — narrow allow-list). Pass the LaTeX without surrounding `$$`. Optional `title`. Returns the relative path; pair with `telegram_send_photo`. |
| `telegram_send_photo` | Send a rendered photo (from `data/renders/`) as an inline Telegram photo with preview. Pair with `render_html` or `render_latex`. |

### Browser

Drive a real headless Chromium for pages `WebFetch` can't reach
(JS-rendered, multi-step, form-driven). One warm browser is reused for
the whole session; `browser_navigate` opens a page and the rest of the
tools act on that **same page** across the turn — so flows like *search →
open the images tab → grab the first image → send it* work. Live network
is allowed here (unlike renders), but localhost / RFC1918 / link-local /
`file://` targets are refused. On by default; disable by listing the
tools in `builtin_tools_disabled`.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `browser_navigate` | Open a URL in the shared Chromium page and wait for the DOM. Start here, then use the other `browser_*` tools on the same page. ~30s load budget. |
| `browser_back` | Go back one entry in the page history. Returns the URL landed on. |
| `browser_reload` | Reload the current page (content changed or didn't finish loading). |
| `browser_reset` | Close the page and clear cookies/state; the next `browser_navigate` opens a fresh isolated tab. |
| `browser_click` | Click an element. Waits up to ~10s for it to be actionable. |
| `browser_fill` | Type a value into an input/textarea (replaces existing content). Pair with `browser_click` to submit. |
| `browser_press_key` | Press a key (`Enter` to submit, `Tab` to move focus); optional selector targets a field. |
| `browser_select_option` | Choose an option in a native `<select>` dropdown (use instead of `browser_fill`). |
| `browser_scroll` | Scroll the page (or a selector into view) to reveal lazy-loaded content. |
| `browser_get_text` | Return the visible text of the page, or one element via CSS selector. Truncated. |
| `browser_get_html` | Return the page HTML, or one element's inner HTML. Use when structure/attributes matter. Truncated. |
| `browser_get_attribute` | Read one HTML attribute of an element — e.g. an image's `src`, a link's `href`. |
| `browser_list` | List elements matching a selector with their text and href/src — pick which link/image to act on. |
| `browser_wait_for` | Wait for an element to appear (after an async-loading click) before reading or acting. |
| `browser_screenshot` | Screenshot the page (or one element) to a PNG under `data/renders/`; pair with `telegram_send_photo`. |
| `browser_download` | Download the original file at a URL (typically an image) into `data/renders/` and return its path; pair with `telegram_send_photo`. Get the URL first with `browser_get_attribute`. |

### Memory (`memories/`)

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `memory_list` | List existing memory files, each with its frontmatter description (progressive disclosure, like `skill_list`). Legacy files without frontmatter show just path + size. |
| `memory_search` | Search the text inside memory files for keywords; returns matching lines, best matches first. |
| `memory_read` | Read a memory file by relative path. |
| `memory_write` | Create or overwrite a memory file. Content **must** begin with name/description frontmatter (the template); writes without it are rejected. Read-before-write rail enforced; 64 KiB cap. |
| `memory_append` | Append text to a memory file's body **and** refresh its frontmatter description (so `memory_list` stays current). Name is preserved or derived from the filename; the first append migrates a legacy file onto the template. |
| `telegram_send_memory_document` | Deliver a memory file to a chat as a downloadable Telegram document. Path-locked to the memory root. Optional caption + reply-to. |

**One store.** All memory lives in the single `memories/` folder at the repo
root. It is git-tracked, so memories survive a volume loss and the operator can
commit them; in Docker it's bind-mounted so runtime writes land in the host
checkout. The bot reads, searches, writes, **and** appends here — there is no
read-only tier. See [`memories/README.md`](../memories/README.md).

Every memory is named by its full path starting with `memories/`. The prefix is
required; a bare path like `notes/ref.md` is rejected, so pass paths verbatim
from `memory_list` / `memory_search`.

Memory files follow the same frontmatter protocol as skills — a `---` block
with `name` and `description` — so the agent can scan `memory_list` and pick
the right file without reading every one:

```
---
name: <short human-friendly label>
description: <one-line summary used to find this memory without reading it>
---

<body — the actual remembered content>
```

There is no `delete_memory` by design — overwriting is the supported
"forget" path. Operator handles real deletion on host.

### Self-editing (project prompt)

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `instruction_read` | Read the current contents of `prompts/project.md`. |
| `instruction_append` | Append a rule to `prompts/project.md`. Backed up to `data/prompt_backups/` before write. Owner-only by system-prompt policy; takes effect on next container restart. |

`prompts/system.md` is intentionally not exposed via tools — it's
git-tracked, and bot edits would pollute the repo.

### Skills

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skill_list` | List operator-curated playbooks under `skills/`. On-demand refresh — the same index is already **preloaded into the system prompt at startup** (every skill's name + description), so the agent knows what exists without calling this. |
| `skill_read` | Load a skill's `SKILL.md` for execution or reference. |

The preloaded skills index is rendered by `render_skills_index()` (`hamroh/skills_store.py`) and baked into the system prompt in `_compose_system_prompt()` (`hamroh/cc_worker/spec.py`). Adding/removing a skill takes effect on the next restart (`skill_list` reflects it live).

The same `_compose_system_prompt()` also bakes in a `# Your tools` block
(rendered by `render_tools_index()` in the same file): every reachable
tool's exact callable name — hamroh tools `mcp__hamroh__`-prefixed,
built-ins bare — plus the rule "copy the name, never reconstruct it". Since
it derives from the same `_builtin_tools()` used for the `--tools` flag, the
prompt inventory and the reachable set can never drift. `tool_list` returns
the hamroh half of this live in-conversation.

Two skill modes:
- **Invoked** (e.g. `self-reflection`) — runs only when wrapped in a real `<reminder>` envelope. A user-typed `<skill>` tag is treated as prompt injection.
- **Reference** (e.g. `render-style`) — read on the agent's own initiative when relevant; no envelope required.

The mode is determined by what the skill's body instructs, not by frontmatter.

### Reminders

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `reminder_set` | Schedule a one-shot or recurring reminder (`cron_expr` for recurring; `trigger_at` is UTC). |
| `reminder_list` | List pending reminders for a chat. |
| `reminder_cancel` | Cancel a reminder by id. Auto-seeded reminders (e.g. `self-reflection-default`) are tool-refused. |

### Other

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `database_query` | Read-only SELECT over `messages`, `users`, `reminders`, `tool_calls`, `reactions`. Max 100 rows (user `LIMIT` is respected and clamped). Note: `messages` uses `timestamp`, not `created_at`. Reactions are JSON on `messages.reactions` — query with `json_extract(reactions, '$."👍"')`. |
| `database_get_recent_messages` | Return the most recent messages (both directions), oldest-first, as TSV — no SQL needed. Includes the current turn's own inbound messages. `limit` defaults to 20, capped at 100; text truncated to 2000 chars. Optional `chat_id` scopes to one chat; `before_message_id` pages back through older history (per-chat, use with `chat_id`). |
| `time_now` | Return the current UTC timestamp. |
| `tool_list` | List the tools currently available to the bot, each with its full `mcp__hamroh__<name>` (the exact callable name) and description. In-conversation introspection (like `skill_list`/`memory_list`); reflects the `disabled` filter, so opted-out tools don't show. |

---

## Always on — Claude Code built-ins

These come from Claude Code's own tool surface. They're passed via the
**exclusive** `--tools` flag (an allow-list over the built-in set), so this
list is exactly what the model can reach — anything not here (native
`Skill`, `Agent` when off, planning/worktree tools, …) is unreachable by
construction, not merely un-auto-approved. The set is built by
`_builtin_tools()` in `hamroh/cc_worker/spec.py` from `BASE_BUILTIN_TOOLS`
+ `TASK_TOOLS`, plus whatever the `tool_groups` flags unlock.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `WebFetch` | Fetch a URL and ask a small model to extract from it. The system prompt forbids internal/private URLs (localhost, RFC1918, link-local) — refuse those. |
| `WebSearch` | Web search via Claude Code's built-in. |
| `StructuredOutput` | The turn-end tool: the model calls it with `{action, reason, …}` to close each turn. The worker keys on it (`event_handlers.py`), so it must always be reachable. |
| `ToolSearch` | Load deferred tool schemas on demand. Idle when nothing is deferred (hamroh's own tools are `alwaysLoad`); does real work once an external MCP is configured. |
| `ListMcpResourcesTool` / `ReadMcpResourceTool` | Reach MCP *resources* (URI-addressable data) an external MCP server may expose. hamroh's own server exposes none, so these are no-ops until a resource-bearing MCP is enabled. |
| `WaitForMcpServers` | Block on an external MCP server that is still connecting. |
| `TaskCreate` / `TaskGet` / `TaskList` / `TaskUpdate` | Session task-checklist, so the bot can track a multi-step turn (e.g. a research digest fanning out over many sources). No permission required. |

The MCP-discovery and task tools are read-only / no-permission and harmless
when idle. `TaskStop`/`TaskOutput` are deliberately omitted (background-task
control the fire-and-forget bot doesn't need; `TaskOutput` is deprecated).

---

## Opt-in tool groups

Two configuration layers feed the bot's tool surface:

* **`plugins.json`** at repo root — single source of truth for
  tool-group toggles, the list of external MCP servers, the
  `builtin_tools_disabled` list, and `skills_disabled`. The operator
  copies the shipped `plugins.json.example` once
  (`cp plugins.json.example plugins.json`), edits, and restarts.
  `plugins.json` is gitignored so customisations stay local.
* **`.env`** — credentials for external services (Jira, GitLab,
  GitHub) only. Referenced from `plugins.json` via `${VAR}`.

Changes to either take effect on container restart.

### `plugins.json` shape

```jsonc
{
  "tool_groups": {
    "bash": false,
    "code": false,
    "subagents": false
  },
  "mcps": [
    {
      "name": "mcp-atlassian",
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse",
      "allowed_tools": ["mcp__mcp-atlassian"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "skills_disabled": []
}
```

* `tool_groups` — flips for the Claude-Code built-ins below
  (`bash`, `code`, `subagents`). Edit and restart to flip.
* `mcps[].name` is **load-bearing** — it becomes the
  `mcp__<name>__<tool>` namespace the model sees. Renaming breaks
  operator memory, prompts, and tests. The defaults match today's
  keys exactly (`mcp-atlassian`, `mcp-gitlab`, `github`).
* `mcps[].type` selects the transport: `stdio` (default), `http`, or
  `sse`. Mirrors what Claude Code's `--mcp-config` accepts. See
  "MCP transports" below for the per-transport field shape.
* `mcps[].allowed_tools` is one flat list — exact tool name
  (`mcp__mcp-atlassian__jira_search`) or a server-prefix shorthand
  (`mcp__mcp-gitlab`). Both forms are accepted by Claude Code's
  `--allowedTools`.
* `${VAR}` interpolation runs over `args` (each element), `env`
  values, `url`, and `headers` values — pulling from the process
  env (i.e. `.env`). Concatenation works (`${GITLAB_URL}/api/v4`).
  If any referenced `${VAR}` resolves empty, that MCP is silently
  skipped at boot — preserving today's "credentials missing → MCP
  not spawned" semantics.
* `enabled: false` skips the MCP even if its `${VAR}` refs resolve.
* A missing `plugins.json` boots with empty plugins (locked-down).
  A malformed `plugins.json` crashes boot loudly with a
  `PluginsConfigError`.

### MCP transports

Three transports are supported, exactly as the [MCP
spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) and Claude Code's
`--mcp-config` define them. Mixing fields across transports
(e.g. `command` on an `http` entry) crashes boot.

**`stdio`** — local subprocess (default). hamroh spawns the
command, talks over stdin/stdout. Auth via the subprocess `env`
block.

```jsonc
{
  "name": "github",
  "type": "stdio",          // optional; default when omitted
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
  "env": { "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}" },
  "allowed_tools": ["mcp__github"],
  "enabled": true
}
```

**`http`** — remote streamable-HTTP server. Auth via static
`headers`. Use this for hosted MCPs (Linear, Notion-cloud, GitHub's
remote MCP, etc.) where you've already issued a PAT or OAuth token.

```jsonc
{
  "name": "linear",
  "type": "http",
  "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp",
  "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${LINEAR_API_KEY}" },
  "allowed_tools": ["mcp__linear"],
  "enabled": true
}
```

**`sse`** — Server-Sent Events transport. Same field shape as
`http`. Some hosted MCPs use this; check vendor docs.

```jsonc
{
  "name": "events",
  "type": "sse",
  "url": "https://example.com/sse",
  "headers": { "X-API-Key": "${EVENTS_KEY}" },
  "allowed_tools": ["mcp__events"],
  "enabled": true
}
```

**Auth.** Hamroh doesn't manage OAuth flows — supply an
already-issued token via `${VAR}` interpolation. For interactive
OAuth-managed servers, see Claude Code's MCP docs (it can run the
flow on your behalf when configured outside `plugins.json`).

### Tool groups

These three groups default to **off**. Flip in `plugins.json`
(`tool_groups.<name>: true`).

#### `bash` — shell execution

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Bash` | Run shell commands. |
| `PowerShell` | Run PowerShell commands (Windows / opt-in via `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL`). |
| `Monitor` | Watch a long-running process and stream output back to the model. |

These all share Claude Code's "permission required" risk class — same
trust class. Off by default for safety.

#### `code` — code work

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Edit` | Targeted edits to a file. |
| `Write` | Create or overwrite a file. |
| `Read` | Read a file. |
| `NotebookEdit` | Edit Jupyter notebook cells. |
| `Glob` | Find files by glob pattern. |
| `Grep` | Search file contents. |
| `LSP` | Code intelligence — definitions, references, type errors. Requires a code-intelligence plugin to be installed. |

Useful unit when you want the bot to do real code work (not just chat).
The Telegram-assistant deployment leaves this off and relies on memory
+ project.md for everything it needs to remember.

#### `subagents`

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Agent` | Spawn a subagent with its own context window for an isolated task. Token-heavy — leave off unless you need it. When off, the subagent docs (`prompts/subagents.md`) aren't even loaded, so the model doesn't know the capability exists. |
| `SendMessage` | Resume/steer a background subagent (or message an agent-team teammate). Unlocked together with `Agent`. |

### Adding a new external MCP

1. Append an entry to `mcps` in `plugins.json` with a unique `name`,
   the `command` to spawn (and any `args`), the `env` it needs (use
   `${VAR}` to pull credentials from `.env` rather than committing
   them), and `allowed_tools` listing the exact tool names or
   `mcp__<name>` prefix to advertise.
2. Add any referenced env vars to `.env`.
3. Restart: `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`.
4. Tail logs — you should see `mcp <name> configured (...)`. If it
   says `skipped (unresolved ${VAR} ...)`, an env var is empty.

### Disabling a built-in hamroh tool

The built-ins under "Always on — hamroh built-ins" are
auto-discovered from `hamroh/tools/*.py` and registered every
boot. To hide one (e.g. you don't use polls, or you don't want LaTeX
rendering eating context), list its name in `builtin_tools_disabled`:

```jsonc
{
  "builtin_tools_disabled": [
    "telegram_create_poll", "telegram_stop_poll",
    "render_latex", "render_html", "telegram_send_photo"
  ]
}
```

The tool is skipped at MCP registration time — it's never
instantiated, never advertised, and the model has no way to invoke
it. Names must match an exact tool name (the `name` class attribute
on the `BaseTool` subclass — also the cell text in this doc's
tables). A typo crashes boot with the available list.

There is no curated "essential" set — disabling `telegram_send_message` mutes
the bot, disabling `telegram_read_attachment` makes it blind to inbound
photos and documents. The operator owns this trade-off.

### Disabling a skill

Add the skill's directory name to `skills_disabled`:

```jsonc
{ "skills_disabled": ["render-style"] }
```

Restart. `skill_list` no longer surfaces it and `skill_read` raises
"not found", so envelope-driven invocations
(`<skill name="...">`) can't bypass the toggle either.

### Jira — Atlassian's remote MCP over SSE

The default `plugins.json` ships an `mcp-atlassian` entry pointed at
Atlassian's official remote MCP (`https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse`,
`type: sse`). It's `enabled: false` by default — flip it to `true` to
advertise the `mcp__mcp-atlassian` tools on `--allowedTools`.

**Auth is OAuth, not env vars.** The remote server authenticates via
OAuth, which hamroh does not manage. Establish the grant once on the
host with Claude Code (`claude mcp add --transport sse atlassian
https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse`, then complete the browser login);
Claude Code reuses the stored token. The headless bot can't run the
browser flow itself, so the OAuth grant must already exist on the host.

For the tool list and capabilities see Atlassian's remote MCP docs.

### GitLab — derived from `GITLAB_URL` + `GITLAB_TOKEN`

The default `plugins.json` ships an `mcp-gitlab` entry that
references both vars. When they're set in `.env`, the `mcp-gitlab`
server spawns *and* the `mcp__mcp-gitlab` prefix is added to
`--allowedTools`. Unlike the Jira server, mcp-gitlab is GitLab-only —
the prefix match is safe.

For the canonical GitLab tool list see upstream
<https://github.com/zereight/mcp-gitlab>.

### GitHub — derived from `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`

The default `plugins.json` ships a `github` entry that references the
token. When set in `.env`, the `github` MCP server spawns (via `npx
-y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`) *and* the `mcp__github`
prefix is added to `--allowedTools`. Single-vendor server, blanket
prefix match is safe.

GitHub.com is the default. For GitHub Enterprise, add a
`"GITHUB_HOST": "${GITHUB_HOST}"` line to the `github` plugin's `env`
block in `plugins.json` and set `GITHUB_HOST` (e.g.
`github.example.com`) in `.env`. (The default omits this line so
github.com users aren't blocked by an unset var.)

**How to generate the token (fine-grained PAT — recommended):**

1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta>.
2. **Token name:** `hamroh` (or your bot's name).
3. **Expiration:** 90 days (max for fine-grained). Set a calendar
   reminder to rotate.
4. **Resource owner:** your account, or the org if the bot acts on
   org repos.
5. **Repository access:** "Only select repositories" → pick exactly
   the repos the bot should touch. Never "All repositories" unless
   that's truly what you want.
6. **Repository permissions** — grant only what the bot needs:
   - `Contents` — Read & write (read code, push branches, commit)
   - `Issues` — Read & write (file bug tickets from chat)
   - `Pull requests` — Read & write (open PRs, comment)
   - `Metadata` — Read (mandatory; auto-granted)
   - `Actions` — Read & write (only if the bot should trigger or
     read CI)
   - Everything else: "No access"
7. Click **Generate token**. Copy the `github_pat_...` string — you
   won't see it again.
8. Paste into `.env` as `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=github_pat_...`
   and restart: `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`.

**Avoid classic PATs.** They grant scopes per-org with no per-repo
limit, so a leaked classic token has a much bigger blast radius. The
`?type=beta` URL above gets you the fine-grained kind.

**GitHub Enterprise:** generate the PAT on your Enterprise instance
and also set `GITHUB_HOST=github.your-company.com` in `.env`.

**Swapping the MCP server.** If you'd rather use the official Go-based
[`github/github-mcp-server`](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)
instead of the npm package, edit the `github` entry in `plugins.json`:
swap `command`/`args` and adjust the `env` block. The rest of the
plumbing (allowlist, credential interpolation) stays as-is.

---

## How to enable / disable

**Tool groups** — flip in `plugins.json`:

```jsonc
{ "tool_groups": { "bash": true, "code": true, "subagents": false } }
```

**External MCPs** — credentials in `.env`, advertise/disable in
`plugins.json`:

```bash
# Jira (set all three; mcp-atlassian spawns when present)
JIRA_URL=https://your-site.atlassian.net
JIRA_USERNAME=you@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=...

# GitLab (set both)
GITLAB_URL=https://gitlab.example.com
GITLAB_TOKEN=...

# GitHub
GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=github_pat_...
```

To stop advertising an MCP without removing credentials, flip
`enabled: false` on its entry in `plugins.json`. To remove entirely,
delete the entry.

**Skills** — list directory names in `plugins.json` `skills_disabled`.

Restart the container after any edit: `docker compose up -d
--force-recreate`. Tail logs at startup — `plugins loaded: N enabled
mcp(s), M disabled skill(s), tool_groups={...}` summarises the active
config; `mcp <name> configured (...)` / `mcp <name> skipped (...)`
lines explain each MCP's outcome.

---

## Other CC tools you can wire in

hamroh doesn't expose every Claude Code built-in. The remaining
omissions are deliberate (see the full-catalog audit in the
`BASE_BUILTIN_TOOLS` comment in `hamroh/cc_worker/spec.py`). A fork that
wants any of these can add it to `BASE_BUILTIN_TOOLS` (always on) or a
gated set (`BASH_TOOLS`, `CODE_TOOLS`, `SUBAGENT_TOOLS`) in that same file;
`_builtin_tools()` assembles the final `--tools` list.

Already exposed (don't re-add): the task-checklist tools (`TaskCreate`,
`TaskGet`, `TaskList`, `TaskUpdate`) and MCP-discovery tools
(`ToolSearch`, `ListMcpResourcesTool`, `ReadMcpResourceTool`,
`WaitForMcpServers`) are on by default; `SendMessage` unlocks with
`subagents`.

Notable upstream tools still **off** on purpose:

- **`Skill`** — hamroh runs skills through its own
  `<reminder><skill>` envelope + `mcp__hamroh__skill_read`, not CC's
  native `Skill` tool; leaving it on is a dead-end (empty registry).
- **Scheduled tasks** — `CronCreate`, `CronDelete`, `CronList`. Would
  duplicate hamroh's own `reminder_*` tools.
- **`PushNotification` / `SendUserFile`** — hamroh delivers over
  Telegram; these need Anthropic push infra / Remote Control.
- **`AskUserQuestion`** — interactive multi-choice UI, dead in
  `--print` headless mode; the bot asks via Telegram instead.
- **Planning & worktrees** — `EnterPlanMode`, `ExitPlanMode`,
  `EnterWorktree`, `ExitWorktree`. Dev-loop tools; useful for
  code-work forks.
- **`Artifact`, `RemoteTrigger`, `ScheduleWakeup`,
  `ShareOnboardingGuide`, `Workflow`, `TodoWrite`, `ReportFindings`** —
  claude.ai / Team-plan / deprecated / not applicable to a chat bot.
- **`TaskStop` / `TaskOutput`** — background-task control the
  fire-and-forget bot doesn't need (`TaskOutput` is deprecated).

For each, the upstream
<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference> is authoritative —
it lists permission requirements and behaviour notes that may change
between CC versions.
