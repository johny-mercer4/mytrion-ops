# hamroh documentation

Deep-dive technical documentation. The README is the high-level intro;
this is the manual. Read this when you're modifying internals,
debugging, or auditing.

## Highlights

The parts of hamroh:

- Custom MCP tools: Telegram messaging (text/reply/edit/delete/reactions/polls), memory, chat history, web search/fetch
- Vision + media: read inbound photos/docs/PDFs, render HTML and LaTeX to PNG, send photos back
- Browser automation: drive a real headless Chromium for pages `WebFetch` can't reach (live network, stateful session)
- Self-reasoning loop: after every response (reason: stop)
- Memory: per person, group, instructions, learnings 
- Reminders (one-shot + cron-recurring)
- Agent skills
- plugins.json to extend with external MCPs
- access.json for group and DM access with different access policy.
- Self-reflection and self-evolving loop  
  - A daily self-reflection pass reviews the bot's own mistakes and proposes durable rules for owner approval.
  - The owner can edit the bot's persona from a DM; every edit takes a timestamped backup first.
- Error handling 
  - when tool, mcp, CC session raises an error - model retries 3 times max instead of constantly replying 
  - The `claude` subprocess is supervised: crashes respawn with exponential backoff and the conversation resumes where it left off.
  - If the model writes a reply without sending it, the harness nudges it until the reply is actually delivered.
  - If the API rejects a turn outright, the bot says so and respawns a fresh session automatically.
  - A circuit breaker aborts a turn after repeated tool errors instead of letting it spin for minutes.

## What gets passed to `claude`

hamroh runs Claude inside a long-lived
`claude --print --input-format stream-json` process and limits what Claude
can do with three flags. `--tools` is an **exclusive** allow-list over
Claude Code's built-in tools — anything not on it is unreachable by
construction (not merely un-auto-approved), which is what keeps native
`Skill`, stray built-ins, and other dead-ends off. `--allowedTools` /
`--disallowedTools` then handle permission auto-approval and a
belt-and-braces deny list. By default the bot has its own MCP tools (in
`hamroh/tools/`, served by a local MCP server) plus a fixed built-in set:
`WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `StructuredOutput` (the turn-end tool), the
MCP-discovery tools (`ToolSearch`, `List`/`ReadMcpResourceTool`,
`WaitForMcpServers`), and the task-checklist tools (`TaskCreate`,
`TaskGet`, `TaskList`, `TaskUpdate`). The local server is registered with
`alwaysLoad: true` so its tools are always in the model's context — never
deferred behind Claude Code's ToolSearch (which made the bot "forget"
`telegram_send_message` existed). Requires Claude Code ≥ 2.1.121.

The exact callable name of every reachable tool is also rendered into the
system prompt as a `# Your tools` block (see `render_tools_index()` in
`hamroh/cc_worker/spec.py`), so the model copies names instead of guessing
them — hamroh tools `mcp__hamroh__`-prefixed, built-ins bare.

The toggle source of truth is [`plugins.json`](../plugins.json) at
the repo root:

* `tool_groups` — flips for the dangerous CC built-ins. `bash`
  unlocks `Bash` / `PowerShell` / `Monitor`; `code` unlocks `Edit` /
  `Write` / `Read` / `NotebookEdit` / `Glob` / `Grep` / `LSP`;
  `subagents` unlocks `Agent`.
* `mcps` — list of external MCP servers to spawn. Three transports
  supported: `stdio`, `http`, `sse`. `${VAR}` references pull
  credentials from `.env`. The shipped `plugins.json.example`
  carries sample Jira / GitLab / GitHub entries you can keep, edit,
  or delete — they're starting points, not first-class. Add a new
  entry to plug in any other MCP server.
* `builtin_tools_disabled` — names of hamroh built-in tools to
  hide (e.g. `telegram_create_poll`, `render_html`). Filtered at MCP
  registration time, never advertised to Claude.
* `skills_disabled` — names of skill directories to hide.

The full per-tool list and the schema reference live in
[tools.md](tools.md); the loader is `hamroh/plugins.py`; the
allow/deny argv is assembled in `hamroh/cc_worker/spec.py`.

## Full configuration

All settings come from environment variables (or a `.env` file). They are
read once when the bot starts, in `hamroh/config.py` (`Config.from_env`).
The rest of the code reads values from the `Config` object, never from
`os.environ` directly. To add a new setting, add a field to `Config`
instead of calling `os.environ.get` from somewhere else. Tests build a
`Config.for_test(tmp_path)` and set values on it, so they don't depend on
what's in your environment.

The one allowed exception is `hamroh/plugins.py` — it reads
`os.environ` directly to substitute `${VAR}` references in
`plugins.json` `mcps[].args`, `env`, `url`, and `headers` values.
That's how an external MCP's credentials reach the spawned server
(or the auth headers for an HTTP/SSE MCP) without being copied
into a `Config` field.

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | yes | — | from @BotFather |
| `HAMROH_OWNER_ID` | yes | — | your numeric Telegram user id |
| `HAMROH_MODEL` | yes | — | which Claude model to use (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`); passed to `--model` |
| `HAMROH_EFFORT` | yes | — | how hard Claude thinks; passed to `--effort` (one of `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`) |
| `HAMROH_DATA_DIR` | no | `./data` | SQLite, memories, access config, raw CC logs |
| `HAMROH_ACCESS_PATH` | no | repo-root `access.json` | override where `access.json` lives (mainly so the e2e harness can point at a temp file). |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_BIN` | no | `claude` | name or full path of the `claude` program |
| `HAMROH_DEBOUNCE_MS` | no | `0` | wait this long after a message before sending it to Claude. Messages that arrive during the wait are bundled into one turn. `0` = send right away. |
| `HAMROH_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN` | no | `20` | max DMs per minute from one user. The owner is not limited. Group chats are not limited. |
| `HAMROH_ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES` | no | `20000000` | largest inbound photo/document (20 MB) the bot will download and read; bigger files are refused with a marker. |
| `HAMROH_BROWSER_HEADLESS` | no | `true` | run the automation Chromium headless. Set `false` only for local debugging (visible window). |
| `HAMROH_SELF_REFLECTION_ENABLED` | no | `true` | master switch for the daily self-reflection loop (on by default). When off, the auto-seeded reflection reminder is removed at boot. |
| `HAMROH_SELF_REFLECTION_CRON` | no | `0 0 * * *` | when the daily self-reflection task runs (UTC cron). Default: midnight UTC. Only used when the loop is enabled. |
| `HAMROH_LIVENESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | no | `600` | if Claude is mid-turn and goes silent (no output, no tool activity) for this many seconds, the bot kills it and starts it again. |
| `HAMROH_LIVENESS_POLL_SECONDS` | no | `30` | how often the watcher wakes up to check the timeout above. |
| `HAMROH_TOOL_ERROR_MAX_COUNT` | no | `10` | how many failed tool calls in one turn trip the breaker: too many (within the window below, with no success in between) aborts the turn and restarts the Claude subprocess. Stops the bot from looping forever on a broken tool. |
| `HAMROH_TOOL_ERROR_WINDOW_SECONDS` | no | `600` | if errors keep arriving for this many seconds after the first one in a turn, end the turn — even below the count above. |
| `HAMROH_CRASH_BACKOFF_BASE` | no | `2` | seconds to wait before the first restart after Claude crashes. Doubles after each crash, up to `CRASH_BACKOFF_CAP`. |
| `HAMROH_CRASH_BACKOFF_CAP` | no | `64` | maximum wait between restarts. Once the wait reaches this, it stops growing. |
| `HAMROH_CRASH_LIMIT` | no | `10` | how many crashes within `CRASH_WINDOW_SECONDS` count as "too many". When reached, the bot tells the owner (crashes are the operator's to handle, so waiting chats stay silent), then exits — and something outside (systemd, docker) is expected to restart the whole bot. |
| `HAMROH_CRASH_WINDOW_SECONDS` | no | `600` | the time window used for `CRASH_LIMIT`. Only crashes from the last X seconds are counted. |
External-service credentials referenced by the default `plugins.json`
via `${VAR}`. Set these in `.env` to make the corresponding MCP
spawn; clear them to silently skip its MCP at boot.

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GITLAB_URL` | no | — | GitLab URL — referenced by the `mcp-gitlab` plugin entry |
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | no | — | GitLab personal access token — same |
| `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | no | — | GitHub PAT — referenced by the `github` plugin entry. For Enterprise, add `GITHUB_HOST` to the entry's `env` block in `plugins.json` and set it here too. |

Who can DM the bot or use it in groups is set in `access.json` at the
repo root (sibling of `plugins.json`), not in environment variables.
See [Access control](#access-control).

## How it works (in detail)

Four parts run inside one Python process:

```
Telegram listener  →  Engine (buffer + send/inject)  →  Claude worker  →  claude process
                                  │                                              │
                                  ▼                                              ▼
                               SQLite                                   MCP server (HTTP, localhost:0)
```

1. **Telegram listener** (`hamroh/telegram_io/`). Uses
   python-telegram-bot v21 in polling mode. For each message it does two
   things: save it to SQLite, then hand it to the engine. Owner-only
   commands (`/kill`, `/health`, `/audit`, the access commands) skip the
   engine and run directly.
2. **Engine** (`hamroh/engine/`). Holds the pending message buffer,
   the debounce timer, the mid-turn processing flag, and the inject path.
   Bundles messages that arrive close together. If a new message comes in
   while Claude is mid-reply, the engine sends it via `worker.inject()` so
   the running turn picks it up. If a turn ends with text but no
   `telegram_send_message` call (we call this "dropped text"), the engine sends a
   corrective `<error>...</error>` block to nudge Claude into using the
   tool.
3. **Claude worker** (`hamroh/cc_worker/`). Starts the `claude`
   process and watches it. Reads stream-json events from stdout, saves
   stderr for diagnostics, stores `session_id` so a restart can resume
   the same conversation, and starts Claude again after a crash —
   waiting longer each time (`CRASH_BACKOFF_BASE`=2s up to
   `CRASH_BACKOFF_CAP`=64s, with a give-up after `CRASH_LIMIT`=10
   crashes in `CRASH_WINDOW_SECONDS`=600s).
4. **MCP server** (`hamroh/mcp_server.py`). A FastMCP server on a
   random port on `127.0.0.1`. It finds every `BaseTool` subclass in
   `hamroh/tools/` and registers it. It writes a small JSON config
   file so Claude can connect via `--mcp-config`.

## Known limitations

### One turn at a time

The engine handles **one Claude turn at a time**. While Claude is busy
with a long task (a code review, a big GitLab search, a complex Jira
query), the engine waits for it to finish. Messages from other chats
sit in the buffer and only go through after the current turn ends.

So a 3-minute code review for Chat A will delay replies to Chat B by up
to 3 minutes. For one user or a small group, this is fine. For busy
setups with many chats, run a separate hamroh for each chat group.

The system prompt tells the bot to send a quick "On it, reviewing
now..." reply via `telegram_send_message` before it starts a long task, so users
know the bot got their message even when the full reply takes time.

## Adding a new tool

Drop a single file in `hamroh/tools/`. No core code changes:

```python
# hamroh/tools/echo.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from hamroh.tools.base import BaseTool, ToolResult


class EchoArgs(BaseModel):
    text: str = Field(description="What to echo back.")


class EchoTool(BaseTool):
    name = "echo"
    description = "Echo a string back to the caller."
    args_model = EchoArgs

    async def run(self, args: EchoArgs) -> ToolResult:
        return ToolResult(content=args.text)
```

Restart `python -m hamroh`. The tool is live.

## Access control

`access.json` at the repo root governs who can talk to the bot.
Hot-reloaded on every inbound message. Gitignored; template at
`access.json.example`. First run seeds `policy: "owner_only"` with
empty allowlists.

```json
{
  "policy": "owner_only",
  "allowed_users": [],
  "allowed_chats": [-1001234567890]
}
```

| Policy | DMs | Groups |
|---|---|---|
| `owner_only` (default) | Owner only | Blocked |
| `allowlist` | Owner + `allowed_users` | `allowed_chats` |
| `open` | Anyone | Any group |

The owner is always allowed in DMs. Blocked messages never reach the
`messages` or `users` tables and never trigger memory writes, tool
calls, or engine work. They are logged to a separate
`unauthorized_messages` table (chat_id, user_id, text, timestamp, …)
so the owner can review demand without polluting the main history.

In DMs only, the first blocked message from a new chat receives a
one-time canned reply: `"This is a private assistant. Please contact
the owner if you want an access."` Subsequent messages from the same
chat are silently dropped (still logged). Unauthorized groups stay
fully silent. Server-side logs continue to record every attempt.

### Owner commands

Owner-only — silently no-op for everyone else. `update.effective_user.id
== HAMROH_OWNER_ID` is the actual gate; `BotCommandScopeChat` just
hides the `/` menu from non-owners.

```
/access                      Show policy + allowlists
/allow user <id>             Add user to allowed_users
/allow group <chat_id>       Add chat to allowed_chats
/deny user <id>              Remove user
/deny group <chat_id>        Remove chat
/policy <owner_only|allowlist|open>
/pause                       Drop all inbound messages until /resume —
                             messages still arrive but are dropped (not
                             queued); in-memory only, resets on restart
/resume                      Re-enable message forwarding
/kill                        SIGTERM (graceful shutdown)
/reset_session               Clear the saved Claude session id and restart —
                             fresh context, chat history and memories kept
/health                      Pause status, last send, reminder state,
                             rate-limit notices, current turn duration,
                             queued messages
/audit                       Recent tool failures, backups, memory footprint
/logs [N]                    Tail the JSON log file (last 4096 chars, or last
                             N lines when N is given)
```

Application logs are written two ways: human-readable text to the console
(captured by `docker logs`) and a structured JSON line per record to
`data/logs/hamroh.log` (rotated daily, 7 days kept). Each JSON record carries
`ts`, `level`, `component` (derived from the logger — `dispatcher`, `cc_worker`,
`tx`, `mcp`, `reminder`, …), `logger`, and `msg`. The root level is set by
`HAMROH_LOG_LEVEL` (default `INFO`); `/logs` tails this file from Telegram.

Edit `access.json` directly if you prefer — changes are hot-reloaded.

## Memory

`memories/*.md` is where the bot keeps its notes. It has six tools:

- `memory_list` — list the files
- `memory_search` — search the text inside files for keywords, best matches first
- `memory_read` — read a file (cuts off at 64 KiB)
- `memory_write` — create or overwrite a file (max 64 KiB)
- `memory_append` — add text to an existing file
- `telegram_send_memory_document` — send a memory file to a chat as a Telegram
  document (path-locked to `memories/`, optional caption + reply-to)

**Read before write.** To overwrite or append to a file that already
exists, the bot has to read it first in the same session. Brand-new files
are exempt. The list of "files I've read" is held in memory and clears
every time the bot restarts, so a fresh start has to re-read before
changing anything. This stops the bot from accidentally destroying notes
you wrote but it never read.

**No delete tool, on purpose.** If the bot wants to "forget" something,
it has to overwrite the file. Actually deleting a file is up to you:
`rm memories/<file>` on the host.

### One store: `memories/`

All memory lives in the single `memories/` folder at the repo root — one store,
no read-only tier. The bot reads, searches, writes, and appends here; you can
seed a file yourself and it shows up on the next `memory_list`.

The folder is **git-tracked**, so memories carry full history and survive a
lost volume, rebuild, or new machine. In Docker it's bind-mounted
(`./memories:/app/memories`), so runtime writes land in your checkout, ready to
`git commit`.

Every memory is named by its **full path** starting with `memories/` — a bare
`notes/ref.md` is rejected, so pass paths verbatim from `memory_list` /
`memory_search`. See [`memories/README.md`](../memories/README.md) for the
full how-to.

### Learning — `self/learnings.md`

Mistakes, corrections, and patterns the bot wants to carry forward live
in `memories/self/learnings.md`. Conventions (enforced by the system
prompt):

- **On correction, same-turn capture.** When a user corrects the bot, or
  it notices mid-conversation it got something wrong, it writes a new
  `## <date> — <topic>` entry before the turn ends. Don't batch, don't
  defer — the signal evaporates fast.
- **`[pending]` marker** in the h2 header flags an entry as a candidate
  for promotion to a durable rule in `prompts/project.md`. Plain headers
  (no marker) are pure history. The daily self-reflection skill picks up
  `[pending]` entries and stress-tests them (see below). Status
  transitions: `[pending]` → `[promoted]` / `[discarded]` / `[refined]`.
- **`**Proposed rule:**` line** accompanies every `[pending]` entry so
  the skill knows what rule text to consider. Without it, the skill asks
  the operator to re-file the entry.

## Rendered visuals

Two tools turn structured data into a Telegram photo:

- `render_html(html, width?=800, height?=600, title?)` — runs the HTML
  through headless Chromium (Playwright) with **all outbound network
  blocked at the route layer**, takes a full-page PNG, saves it under
  `data/renders/<utc-stamp>-<slug>-<rand>.png`, returns the relative
  path. Inline any CSS/JS the page needs (Chart.js, D3, fonts) — the
  browser can't fetch.
- `telegram_send_photo(chat_id, path, caption?, reply_to_message_id?)` — sends
  a file from `data/renders/` as an inline Telegram photo. Path-locked
  to the renders root with the same hardening as `memory_read`.

The agent's `render_html` calls follow the house style in
[`skills/render-style/`](../skills/render-style/) — three skeletons
(dashboard, timeline, architecture diagram) the agent reads via
`skill_read render-style` before composing HTML. Tokens are dark-navy
with semantic colors (green/blue/red/amber/purple/cyan/gray).

Playwright + Chromium are pre-installed in the Docker image. For local
runs: `uv sync && uv run playwright install chromium`.

## Browser automation

For pages `WebFetch` can't reach (JS-rendered, multi-step, form-driven),
the bot drives a real headless Chromium. Unlike `render_html` — which
runs network-blocked — the browser tools have **live network access**,
so this is the path for interacting with the open web. Private/internal
targets (localhost, RFC1918, link-local, `file://`) are still refused.

The key difference from the one-shot render path is **session state**:
`browser_navigate` opens one shared page, and every other `browser_*`
tool acts on that same page for the rest of the turn. One warm Chromium
instance is kept alive across the whole bot session (not relaunched per
call), and popups / new tabs are followed automatically. This lets the
agent chain steps — *navigate → wait for an element → click → read text
→ screenshot → send* — the way a person would.

The full tool list (navigate/history, interact, read, capture) is in
[tools.md](tools.md#browser). All sixteen are on by default; disable any
by name via `builtin_tools_disabled` in `plugins.json`.

## Self-reflection skill

A daily two-phase loop that drives self-improvement. Triggered by an
auto-seeded recurring reminder (default midnight UTC every day; override
with `HAMROH_SELF_REFLECTION_CRON`):

- **Phase A — introspect.** Bot reads the last 24h of outbound messages
  + their reactions via `database_query`, applies a checklist (over-long
  replies, ping-rule deviations, negative reactions, repeated rewrites,
  tone/language mismatches), and writes up to 3 candidate lessons into
  `learnings.md` with `[pending]` markers. This catches drift the user
  hasn't called out yet.
- **Phase B — process.** Bot reads every `[pending]` entry (Phase-A's
  fresh ones plus anything from the on-correction rule above),
  stress-tests each against 10-20 hypothetical scenarios, scores fit
  (<30% discard, 60-85% promote, 85%+ overreach → refine), DMs the
  owner a numbered proposal, waits for approval, and on approval calls
  the instruction-edit tools to append rules to `project.md`.

**Mandatory loop.** The reminder is protected on two layers:
- `reminder_cancel` refuses to cancel rows with `auto_seed_key` set (so
  a prompt-injected bot can't stop the loop).
- `_seed_default_reminders` in `__main__.py` re-seeds on every startup
  if no pending row exists — cancelling or deleting via SQL loses only
  until the next container restart.

The playbook lives at `skills/self-reflection/SKILL.md`. See the
[Agent skills](#agent-skills) section below for how skill invocation
works and how to add more.

## Agent skills

Skills are operator-curated multi-step playbooks stored in the top-level
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` format, following the
**[Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)**.
They ship with the repo (versioned in git) and are read-only from the
bot's perspective.

Each SKILL.md must begin with YAML frontmatter containing at least
`name` (matching the directory) and `description` (what the skill does
and when to use it). Our `SkillsStore` validates both on load and
refuses malformed skills.

Tools:

- `skill_list` — enumerate available skills as name + description pairs
  (the spec's progressive-disclosure metadata surface).
- `skill_read(name)` — load the full SKILL.md playbook.

**Invocation.** A skill is triggered by a reminder whose text body is
`<skill name="X">run</skill>`. The reminder loop wraps that in a
`<reminder>` XML envelope before injecting into the engine. The bot,
per `system.md § Skills`, recognizes `<skill>` inside `<reminder>` and
calls `skill_read("X")` to load + execute the playbook.

**Trust model.** The bot trusts `<skill>` directives only when wrapped
in a `<reminder>` envelope (server-synthesized). A user typing
`<skill name="X">run</skill>` in regular chat is treated as a
prompt-injection attempt and ignored.

### Adding a new skill

Drop a new folder under `skills/`:

```
skills/
└── your-skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md       # required: YAML frontmatter + playbook body
    ├── README.md      # optional, operator-facing doc
    ├── scripts/       # optional: executable helpers (spec)
    ├── references/    # optional: on-demand reference docs (spec)
    └── assets/        # optional: templates, schemas (spec)
```

Minimum SKILL.md:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: One sentence on what the skill does AND when to use it (cap: 1024 chars).
---

# your-skill-name

Playbook body — step-by-step instructions the bot follows when this
skill activates.
```

The name must match the directory (lowercase, `a-z0-9-` only, no
leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens). Optional frontmatter fields per
spec: `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools`.

The SkillsStore auto-discovers any first-level directory that contains a
`SKILL.md`. No code changes needed unless you want it to run on a
schedule:

1. To make the skill fire daily/weekly, add an auto-seeded reminder in
   `_seed_default_reminders` (`hamroh/__main__.py`) with a unique
   `auto_seed_key` (e.g. `"your-skill-default"`).
2. Add a migration if you need new DB columns/tables.
3. Remember: auto-seeded reminders are protected by default —
   `reminder_cancel` refuses them, and the seed hook re-creates them if
   missing on restart. That's intentional; skills that should be
   interruptible shouldn't use the auto_seed_key path.

The playbook itself is markdown the bot reads and executes step by step.
See `skills/self-reflection/SKILL.md` as a worked example. Keep the
playbook self-contained: preconditions check, the data the skill should
read, the decisions it should make, and the tools it should call.

## Reminders

The agent can schedule one-shot and recurring reminders via three tools:

- `reminder_set` — schedule a reminder with a UTC trigger time and
  optional cron expression
- `reminder_list` — show pending reminders for a chat
- `reminder_cancel` — cancel a pending reminder by id

Reminders are stored in the `reminders` SQLite table. A background task
polls every 60 seconds for due entries and injects them into the engine
as synthetic inbound messages. The agent then sends the reminder text to
the appropriate chat. Recurring reminders (cron) automatically advance
to the next occurrence.

Reminders fire on time even if the bot is mid-conversation. When the
fire happens during an active turn, the synthetic reminder message is
queued and runs as soon as the current turn ends.

A reminder row is only marked `sent` (or its cron advanced) once the
CC subprocess has actually consumed the turn. If CC crashes or wedges
mid-turn, the row stays `pending` and the next 60s loop tick re-fires
it — without this, a wedged subprocess would silently lose the
reminder.

All times are stored in UTC. The system prompt instructs the agent to
ask users for their timezone and convert to UTC before setting
reminders.

### Custom reminders (`default-reminders.json`)

Beyond reminders the agent sets at runtime, you can ship a fixed set of
**recurring** reminders with the bot in a git-tracked `default-reminders.json`
at the repo root (gitignored in this framework repo; copy
`default-reminders.json.example` to start, or keep it in your instance repo and
bind-mount it — see [Run your own agent](#run-your-own-agent)).

```json
{
  "reminders": [
    {
      "name": "morning-trends",
      "cron": "0 6 * * *",
      "chat": "owner",
      "text": "Post today's trends digest."
    }
  ]
}
```

Each object: `name` (required, unique — identifies the reminder across edits),
`cron` (required, 5-field, UTC), `text` (required), `chat` (optional: `"owner"`
default, or a numeric chat id), `enabled` (optional: `true` default, or `false`
to turn the reminder off without deleting its entry). JSON has no comments, so
keep notes out of the file itself.

`text` may be a plain string or a **list of strings joined with newlines** —
handy for long, multi-paragraph prompts, since JSON has no multi-line literals.
Both forms produce identical text (and the same seed key), so switching between
them never triggers a reseed:

```json
{
  "reminders": [
    {
      "name": "morning-brief",
      "cron": "0 6 * * *",
      "text": [
        "Good morning. Put together today's brief:",
        "",
        "1. Top 3 AI stories.",
        "2. Calendar conflicts this week."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

How it behaves:

- **Reconciled at every boot.** The startup hook diffs the file against
  the database: declared entries with no pending row are seeded, and
  committed rows no longer in the file are cancelled.
- **Edits apply on restart.** The seed key is content-addressed
  (`committed:<name>:<hash of cron+text+chat>`), so editing any field
  cancels the stale row and seeds a fresh one. Removing an entry cancels
  it, and so does setting `"enabled": false` — the entry stays in the file
  as an off switch, and flipping it back to `true` seeds the reminder again.
- **Source of truth is the file.** Because each row carries an
  `auto_seed_key`, the agent cannot cancel these from chat (same gate as
  the self-reflection loop) — change the file and restart instead.
- **Recurring only.** A one-shot would re-fire on every restart once
  sent, so only cron reminders are accepted here; for a one-off, ask the
  bot in chat (it uses `reminder_set`).
- A missing file means no custom reminders; a malformed file crashes boot
  loudly rather than silently dropping a reminder.

Implementation: parser in `hamroh/scheduler/reminders_config.py`, reconciler
`_reconcile_committed_reminders` in `hamroh/startup.py`.

## Run your own agent

Never fork. Keep this repo as the framework, pull it into your own agent
repo as a **git submodule**, and put your identity — persona, skills,
memories, config — in files that bind-mount over the image at runtime.

```
my-agent/                    # your private repo
├── framework/               # git submodule → github.com/Rustam-Z/hamroh
├── Dockerfile         
├── docker-compose.yml       # runs framework/, mounts the files below
├── .env                     # bot token, owner id, model, secrets — gitignore this
├── prompts/
│   ├── system.md            # seeded from framework/ — required
│   └── project.md           # bot name, language, personality
├── skills/                  # framework playbooks (seeded) + your own
├── memories/                # the bot's memory (git-tracked)
├── plugins.json             # tools + MCP capability surface
├── access.json              # DM / group policy
└── default-reminders.json   # custom recurring reminders
```

Set it up once:

```bash
git init my-agent && cd my-agent
git submodule add https://github.com/Rustam-Z/hamroh framework
cp framework/.env.example .env             # fill TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, HAMROH_OWNER_ID, model
cp framework/prompts/project.md.example prompts/project.md
cp framework/prompts/system.md prompts/system.md         # required — re-copy after a framework bump
cp -R framework/skills/. skills/                         # keep the built-ins; add your own too
cp framework/plugins.json.example plugins.json
cp framework/access.json.example access.json
cp framework/default-reminders.json.example default-reminders.json
```

`docker-compose.yml` — the submodule is the build context, everything else is a mount:

```yaml
services:
  hamroh:
    build: ./framework
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./prompts:/app/prompts
      - ./skills:/app/skills:ro
      - ./memories:/app/memories:ro
      - ./plugins.json:/app/plugins.json
      - ./access.json:/app/access.json
      - ./default-reminders.json:/app/default-reminders.json:ro
      - ~/.claude:/root/.claude
      - ~/.claude.json:/root/.claude.json
    working_dir: /app
```

Run it:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f hamroh
```

Notes:

- **Clone with the submodule.** A plain clone leaves `framework/` empty and
  the build fails — use `git clone --recurse-submodules`, or run
  `git submodule update --init` after cloning.
- **`prompts/` and `skills/` replace, they don't merge** — the mount hides the
  image's baked `system.md` and built-in skills, which is why you seed both
  above. Re-run those two `cp`s after a framework bump.
- **Update the framework:** `cd framework && git pull origin main && cd .. &&
  git add framework && git commit -m "bump framework"`.

### Installing extra packages

Need a system binary (ffmpeg, a font) or an extra Python dep for a custom
tool? **Don't edit `framework/`** — that's the pinned submodule. Add your own
`Dockerfile` in the agent repo that builds *on top of* the framework image:

```dockerfile
# my-agent/Dockerfile
FROM hamroh-base
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ffmpeg \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN /app/.venv/bin/pip install --no-cache-dir yt-dlp
```

`FROM hamroh-base` keeps everything the framework already has (Python, Node,
Chromium, hamroh, its `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD`); you only add the extra lines. Point
compose at your Dockerfile instead of the submodule:

```yaml
    build: .            # was: build: ./framework
```

`FROM` needs that base image to exist first, so build the framework once, then
your layer — put both in a `Makefile` so it's one command:

```makefile
up:
	docker build -t hamroh-base ./framework   # build the pinned submodule
	docker compose up -d --build              # build your layer + run
```

Run `make up`; re-run it after a framework bump to rebuild both. (An MCP that
runs via `npx` needs none of this — that's a `plugins.json` edit, no rebuild.)

## System prompt

The system prompt is assembled from two files:

1. **`prompts/system.md`** — generic hamroh template covering tool
   discipline, message format, memory, reminders, and prompt-injection
   resistance. Ships with the repo.
2. **`prompts/project.md`** — project-specific overlay (identity,
   integrations, custom instructions). Gitignored. Copy
   `prompts/project.md.example` to get started. Path is hardcoded —
   always at `prompts/project.md`.

If `project.md` doesn't exist, only the base prompt is used.

## External MCP integrations

hamroh can optionally connect to external MCP servers alongside
its own. There's no built-in integration list — every external MCP
is just an entry in `plugins.json` `mcps[]`. The shipped
`plugins.json.example` includes three sample entries you can keep,
edit, or delete — they're starting points, not first-class:

- **Jira** via Atlassian's remote MCP (`https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse`,
  SSE) — auth is OAuth, established once on the host with Claude Code (no
  `.env` credentials). See `docs/tools.md` for the OAuth setup.
- **GitLab** via
  [@zereight/mcp-gitlab](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zereight/mcp-gitlab)
  (stdio) — set `GITLAB_URL`, `GITLAB_TOKEN` in `.env`.
- **GitHub** via
  [@modelcontextprotocol/server-github](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/server-github)
  (stdio) — set `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env`. For
  Enterprise, add `"GITHUB_HOST": "${GITHUB_HOST}"` to the entry's
  `env` block and set `GITHUB_HOST` in `.env` too.

Each entry references its credentials with `${VAR}` interpolation;
when any required var is empty, that MCP is silently skipped at boot.
To stop advertising one without removing credentials, flip
`enabled: false` on its entry. To remove permanently, delete the
entry.

Adding a new MCP (Notion, Linear, Slack, Postgres, Playwright, your
own — stdio, http, or sse) is a `plugins.json` edit — no Python
change. See [tools.md](tools.md) for the schema and per-transport
shape.

## Monitoring & observability

Hamroh gives you **four complementary windows** into what the bot is
doing. Pick whichever fits the moment.

### 1. The live tagged log (the running terminal)

When the bot is running, the foreground terminal prints two streams of
structured tag lines on top of the usual lifecycle messages:

**Conversation transcript** (`hamroh.tx` logger):

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[RX]` | inbound message we forwarded to the engine |
| `[DROP]` | inbound message persisted but dropped (chat not allowed) |
| `[RX↺]` | inbound edited message |
| `[TX]` | outbound `telegram_send_message` / `telegram_reply_to_message` |
| `[EDIT]` / `[DEL]` / `[REACT]` | outbound edits, deletions, reactions |

**Claude Code subprocess transcript** (`hamroh.cc` logger):

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[CC.user]` | the XML batch we just shipped to CC's stdin |
| `[CC.text]` | a text block the assistant emitted (rare; signals dropped-text) |
| `[CC.tool→]` | the assistant called a tool (with args + tool_use_id) |
| `[CC.tool✓]` / `[CC.tool✗]` | a tool returned (success / error) |
| `[CC.done]` | turn finished, parsed `action` + `reason` |

Sample (DM with one message):

```
21:34:12 INFO  hamroh.tx       [RX] DM Alice[12345] m42 | how fast are you
21:34:12 INFO  hamroh.engine   starting turn with 1 msgs
21:34:12 INFO  hamroh.cc       [CC.user] <msg id="42" chat="12345" ...>↵how fast are you↵</msg>
21:34:13 INFO  hamroh.cc       [CC.tool→] mcp__hamroh__send_message({"chat_id":12345,"text":"Honestly?…"}) id=toolu_01
21:34:14 INFO  hamroh.tx       [TX] DM Alice[12345] m43 | Honestly? Not blazing fast 😅 …
21:34:14 INFO  hamroh.cc       [CC.tool✓] id=toolu_01 | sent message_id=43
21:34:14 INFO  hamroh.cc       [CC.done]  action=stop reason=Answered the user's question
```

The `httpx`/`mcp` per-poll noise is silenced by default. To bring it
back for debugging, comment the relevant lines in
`hamroh/startup.py:_setup_logging()`.

### 2. The replayable session viewer (`hamroh.scripts.trace`)

Claude Code persists every CC session as a JSONL file at
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-project-dir>/<session_id>.jsonl`, where
`<encoded-project-dir>` is the absolute project path with every
non-alphanumeric character replaced by `-` (e.g. `/home/alice/hamroh`
→ `-home-alice-hamroh`). `hamroh.scripts.trace` computes this
automatically from the cwd; override with `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` if
needed. This is the **complete conversation log** — every user
envelope, every assistant message, every tool_use, every tool_result,
every thinking block.

Render it as a human-readable transcript:

```bash
# List every session in the project dir; the bot's file is marked
uv run python -m hamroh.scripts.trace --list

# Replay the bot's session (resolved via data/session_id, NOT
# "most-recent-file" — important if you also have your own Claude Code
# session running in the same cwd)
uv run python -m hamroh.scripts.trace

# Replay one specific session
uv run python -m hamroh.scripts.trace --session 87f472fa-5e1a-48d6-bddc-824efca1fea5

# Tail the bot's running session live (refreshes every 0.5s)
uv run python -m hamroh.scripts.trace --follow

# Truncate huge text blocks
uv run python -m hamroh.scripts.trace --max 200

# Escape hatch: pick the most-recently-modified JSONL regardless of owner
uv run python -m hamroh.scripts.trace --latest --follow
```

The default picker reads `data/session_id` first, then falls back to
fingerprinting (a session is "the bot's" iff its first user event
begins with the engine's `<msg ...>` XML envelope). This stops the
renderer from accidentally tailing your own Claude Code session that
happens to be the most recently modified file in the same project
directory.

The renderer is **read-only** and never touches the running hamroh
process — totally safe to run in a second terminal while the bot is
live.

### 3. The raw wire-stream capture (`data/cc_logs/`)

Independent from Claude Code's own session JSONL, hamroh also
captures the raw bytes coming out of the CC subprocess on stdout/stderr
to:

```
data/cc_logs/<session_id>.stream.jsonl   # one event per line, pre-parse
data/cc_logs/<session_id>.stderr.log     # timestamped stderr lines
```

This is the **wire log** (what came out of the subprocess) as opposed
to the *conversation log* (what was in the model's context). The two
overlap mostly but the wire log also captures `result` events, `ping`
frames, and any malformed JSON the parser would otherwise drop. Useful
when debugging parser bugs or weird stream artifacts.

```bash
# Live wire stream
tail -f data/cc_logs/*.stream.jsonl | jq -c .

# CC's stderr (rate-limit notices, retries, warnings)
tail -f data/cc_logs/*.stderr.log
```

Capture is on by default. Files rotate per session id, append across
respawns of the same session, and survive crashes.

### 4. SQLite — auditable, queryable history

Everything that touches Telegram or any MCP tool is in
`data/hamroh.db`. Useful one-liners:

```bash
# Last 10 messages in/out (from any chat)
sqlite3 data/hamroh.db \
  "SELECT direction, chat_id, user_id, substr(text,1,80) AS text
   FROM messages ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Every MCP tool call the bot has made (newest first)
sqlite3 data/hamroh.db \
  "SELECT created_at, tool_name, duration_ms, error
   FROM tool_calls ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20;"

# Per-user activity in a specific chat
sqlite3 data/hamroh.db \
  "SELECT username, first_name, message_count, last_message_date
   FROM users WHERE chat_id = 12345 ORDER BY message_count DESC;"

# Find every reply chain involving a specific user
sqlite3 data/hamroh.db \
  "SELECT message_id, reply_to_id, substr(text,1,100)
   FROM messages WHERE user_id = 12345 AND reply_to_id IS NOT NULL;"
```

`database_query` (the MCP tool) lets the agent run SELECTs against this same
database — sqlglot-validated, capped at 100 rows. `database_get_recent_messages`
returns the latest messages without writing SQL.

### 5. Bonus — interactive replay (`claude --resume`)

Drop into the bot's *exact* conversation state in a real Claude Code
interactive session:

```bash
# Stop hamroh first, OR use --fork-session to branch safely
claude --resume $(cat data/session_id)
```

You're now talking to Claude Code with the bot's full history loaded.
Ask "why did you reply that way to message 591?" and you'll get its
perspective on its own past turns. ⚠️ Don't run this on the same
session id as a live hamroh process unless you pass `--fork-session`.

### Cheatsheet

| You want to know… | Look at |
|---|---|
| Who said what to who right now | the foreground terminal (`[RX]`/`[TX]` lines) |
| Which tools is it calling and why | the foreground terminal (`[CC.tool→]`/`[CC.done]` lines) |
| The full story of a past conversation | `python -m hamroh.scripts.trace --session <sid>` |
| Whether the parser is missing events | `data/cc_logs/<sid>.stream.jsonl` |
| Whether CC is hitting rate limits | `data/cc_logs/<sid>.stderr.log` |
| Aggregate stats / cross-session queries | `sqlite3 data/hamroh.db` |
| What it would say *now* about its own history | `claude --resume $(cat data/session_id) --fork-session` |

## Security model

The agent is a *front-facing public agent*. Anyone in an allowed chat
can talk to it, and they're not always trustworthy. The security model
is enforced by code, not by hope, and tested in
`tests/test_security_invariants.py`.

- **No shell, no edits, no writes outside `memories/`, no general reads
  outside `memories/`, no subagents — by default.** The CC subprocess is
  spawned with an **exclusive** `--tools` built-in allow-list (`WebFetch`,
  `WebSearch`, `StructuredOutput`, the MCP-discovery tools, and the
  task-checklist tools) so every un-listed built-in — `Bash`, `Edit`,
  `Agent`, native `Skill`, … — is unreachable by construction, not just
  un-auto-approved. `--allowedTools mcp__hamroh,WebFetch,WebSearch`
  auto-approves the surface and a belt-and-braces
  `--disallowedTools Bash,PowerShell,Monitor,Edit,Write,Read,
  NotebookEdit,Glob,Grep,LSP,Agent --strict-mcp-config` backs it up. Each
  gated group flips on via `plugins.json` `tool_groups` (which extends the
  `--tools` list); external-MCP tool advertisement follows from
  `plugins.json` `mcps[]` entries whose `${VAR}` references resolve. The
  forbidden flag `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is *never* passed; both
  the argv builder and the spawn-time assertion refuse it. See
  [tools.md](tools.md) for the full per-tool list and the `plugins.json`
  schema.
- **Web access (read-only).** `WebFetch` and `WebSearch` are
  deliberately enabled so the agent can answer questions that need
  fresh information. This is a real trade-off — see the next bullet.
  The system prompt instructs the agent to refuse private/internal
  URLs (localhost, RFC1918, link-local, `.local`), but a determined
  prompt-injection could still get it to fetch one. **Do not deploy
  the bot on a host with sensitive internal endpoints reachable from
  the same network.**
- **MCP namespace lockdown.** The local MCP server is registered as
  `hamroh`, so every hamroh tool Claude sees is named
  `mcp__hamroh__<x>`. The two web tools are Claude Code built-ins,
  not MCP tools, so they show up unprefixed (`WebFetch`, `WebSearch`).
- **Memory writes with safety rails.** `memory_write` and
  `memory_append` exist, but are guarded by:
  - **Path traversal hardening** (no `..`, no absolute paths, no
    symlinks) — applies to writes the same way it applies to reads.
  - **64 KiB per-file size cap** — both writes and post-append totals.
  - **Read-before-write** — overwriting or appending to an *existing*
    file requires `memory_read` to have been called on it first in the
    same session. New files are exempt. The set of "read paths"
    resets on every restart so a fresh process must re-read before
    mutating.
  - **No deletion tool** — forgetting requires explicit overwriting.
- **No filesystem reads outside `memory.py`.** AST scan asserts no
  `open()` / `read_text()` / `read_bytes()` lives in any other tool
  module.
- **No subprocess calls in tools.** AST scan rejects `subprocess.*`,
  `os.system`, `os.popen`, `asyncio.create_subprocess_*` anywhere
  under `hamroh/tools/`. The *only* place those primitives are
  allowed is `cc_worker/worker.py`, which spawns `claude` itself.
- **Owner-only privileged commands.** `/kill`, `/health`, `/audit`,
  `/access`, `/allow`, `/deny`, `/policy` check
  `update.effective_user.id == HAMROH_OWNER_ID` before running and
  silently no-op for anyone else.
- **`database_query` is read-only.** Inputs are parsed with `sqlglot` and
  rejected unless they're a single SELECT. CTEs are walked
  recursively; semicolons, PRAGMA, ATTACH, INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DROP/
  CREATE/ALTER all fail. Results cap at 100 rows; text columns
  truncate at 2000 chars.
- **Per-user inbound DM rate limit.** 20 messages / 60s / user by
  default, DB-backed (`rate_limits` table, fixed-minute buckets) so it
  survives restarts. Enforced at `telegram_io._on_message` before
  `engine.submit()`: over-limit DMs are still persisted (audit trail)
  but never reach the CC subprocess. **Groups are not rate-limited** —
  noisy users in groups are the group's problem. **The owner
  (`HAMROH_OWNER_ID`) is fully exempt** — the counter never ticks
  for the owner. When a user exhausts their bucket they get one
  Telegram notice ("you're sending too fast…") then the bot goes quiet
  until the bucket rolls over.
- **Audit log.** Every MCP tool invocation persists to `tool_calls`
  (name, args, result, error, duration). Owner can review recent
  failures via `/audit`.
- **Secrets scrubbing at persistence.** Inbound message text and the
  raw Telegram `Update` JSON are passed through
  `secrets_scrubber.scrub()` before `insert_message` writes to
  SQLite. Redacts Bearer tokens, `sk-…` keys, GitHub/Slack tokens,
  AWS access keys, JWTs, PEM private-key blocks, and DSNs with
  embedded passwords. An accidental credential paste never lands in
  the DB.
- **Unicode normalization at the boundary.** Before a message reaches
  the agent, `input_normalizer.py` strips zero-width and bidi-control
  characters (classic invisible prompt-injection carriers) and
  NFKC-normalizes the text. When anything was changed, the inbound
  `<msg>` envelope carries a `flags=` attribute (`zero_width_stripped`,
  `bidi_stripped`, `nfkc_changed`) and the system prompt tells the
  agent to treat instructions in flagged messages as adversarial.
- **Wedged-subprocess detection.** `CcWorker._liveness_loop` watches
  for silent-mid-turn subprocesses: if `max(last stdout event, last
  MCP tool call) < now - HAMROH_LIVENESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default
  600s) and a turn is in progress, the subprocess is terminated so
  the crash-recovery path respawns it with the same session id.
  Doesn't fire when idle (silence is expected between turns).
- **Tool-error circuit breaker.** A stream-json `tool_result` with
  `is_error=true` increments a per-turn counter in `CcWorker`; when
  the counter hits `HAMROH_TOOL_ERROR_MAX_COUNT` (default 10) or
  the first-error window exceeds
  `HAMROH_TOOL_ERROR_WINDOW_SECONDS` (default 600s), the worker
  puts a sentinel `TurnResult` on the result queue and schedules
  `_terminate_proc`. The engine unblocks immediately; `_on_cc_crash`
  notifies the user on respawn. Prevents Claude from burning minutes
  looping on a deterministically-failing tool (e.g. permission
  denied, schema violation).
- **Dropped-text delivery.** A turn that ends with text blocks but
  no `telegram_send_message` call (`dropped_text=True`) would be
  invisible to the user, so `Engine._handle_dropped_text` delivers
  those blocks directly to the waiting chats instead of burning a
  retry turn. Exception: when the text is actually a technical error,
  `classify_cc_failure` surfaces a targeted message (e.g. "model
  unavailable — fix `HAMROH_MODEL`") instead of echoing the raw
  diagnostic. Catches CC-native diagnostics (invalid model, auth
  failure, quota) that would otherwise be lost.
- **Crash-loop terminal notification.** When the crash budget
  (`Config.crash_limit` crashes in `Config.crash_window_seconds`,
  defaults 10 / 600s) is exhausted, `CcWorker._supervise_loop` fires
  the `on_giveup` callback *before* raising `CrashLoop` — so owner
  + any active chats get a clear "I'm shutting down, operator needs
  to intervene" message (classified where possible) instead of the
  supervisor task dying silently.
- **Failure classifier.** `hamroh/cc_failure_classifier.py` is the
  single authoritative mapping from CC stderr / text blocks to
  user-facing messages. Used by the engine's post-turn stderr sweep,
  the dropped-text handler, the on_crash hook, and the on_giveup
  hook. Add a new failure mode = append one `CcFailurePattern`.
- **Instruction tools are owner-only (any chat).** Two tools —
  `instruction_read` and `instruction_append` — expose
  `prompts/project.md` (and only that file) to the bot. system.md is
  git-tracked, so it's intentionally not exposed; all owner-driven
  customisations accumulate in project.md, which is concatenated
  after system.md to form the full prompt. No code-level permission
  check exists — the owner-only rule is enforced by the system
  prompt. Code rails that DO enforce: the file path is hardcoded,
  the size cap (128 KiB), atomic write, and a timestamped backup
  before every append. Revert is `mv <backup> prompts/project.md &&
  docker compose restart hamroh`. Edits take effect on the next
  CC spawn, not mid-session, which gives the operator a natural
  review window.
- **Skills are operator-curated playbooks.** Markdown files under
  `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` that describe multi-step agent workflows.
  Exposed read-only via `skill_list` / `skill_read`. A skill is
  invoked when a `<reminder>` envelope contains `<skill
  name="X">run</skill>` — the system prompt teaches the bot to
  trust `<skill>` tags only inside that envelope, so a user typing
  one in chat does nothing. The first skill is `self-reflection`: a
  daily loop that stress-tests lessons from `learnings.md` and
  proposes promotions to `project.md`, gated on explicit owner
  approval via the instruction-edit tools above.

If you weaken any of these, the security tests will fail loudly. They
are load-bearing — keep them.

## Manual end-to-end checklist

Once configured, you should be able to:

1. DM the bot, see the bot reply via `telegram_send_message`.
2. Drop `memories/user_preferences.md` containing "Alice prefers
   Russian", ask "what do you know about me?", watch it call
   `memory_list` → `memory_read` and reply in Russian.
3. Send 5 messages in 2 seconds, see them batched into one turn
   (debounce).
4. Send a 6th message *while* it's mid-turn, see it injected.
5. `sqlite3 data/hamroh.db 'SELECT direction, text FROM messages ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;'`
6. Drop `hamroh/tools/echo.py` (above), restart, and watch the bot
   gain the new tool with zero other code changes.
7. `kill -9 $(pgrep -f 'claude --print')`, watch the worker respawn
   within seconds and resume the conversation.
8. Ask the bot to run a shell command — it should refuse, because it
   has no `Bash` tool and its system prompt tells it to.
9. Run `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_security_invariants.py`
   and see all 8 invariants pass.

## When a session breaks

Sometimes the API rejects a turn outright (the result event carries
`is_error`) — for example a usage-policy refusal or a context overflow.
Resuming that session would just replay the rejected content and fail
again, so the engine treats it as broken:

1. It tells the affected chats that the turn failed and that a fresh
   session was started (previous conversation context is gone).
2. It respawns `claude` with no `--resume` and deletes the persisted
   session id in `data/session_id`, so a later restart can't resume
   the broken session either.

The session id normally lives in `data/session_id` (written on clean
shutdown). To force a fresh session manually, send `/reset_session`,
or delete that file while the bot is stopped.

Recoverable failures — rate limit, auth, quota — do **not** trigger
this. The session is fine there; a reset would only lose context. The
engine just reports the error and keeps the session for the next turn.


## What `plugins.json` controls

One file, four blocks. Edit and restart to apply. 

Tool groups (shell / code / subagents, off by default), external MCPs, and toggles to hide built-in tools or skills. A missing file boots locked-down; a malformed one crashes boot loudly. 

- **`tool_groups`** — Claude Code's dangerous built-ins (shell / code editing / subagents). All off by default; flip to `true` to unlock.
- **`mcps`** — external MCP servers (GitHub, Jira, Linear, Notion, your own). One array entry per server, `stdio` / `http` / `sse`, credentials pulled from `.env` via `${VAR}` references — no Python needed.
- **`builtin_tools_disabled`** — hamroh built-ins to hide from the agent (e.g. `telegram_create_poll`).
- **`skills_disabled`** — skill directories under `skills/` to hide.

A missing `plugins.json` boots locked-down (no integrations, no tool groups). A malformed file crashes boot loudly. Full schema, copy-paste examples, and per-MCP setup: [docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md).


```jsonc
{
  "tool_groups": {           // dangerous Claude Code built-ins, all off by default
    "bash":      false,      //   Bash, PowerShell, Monitor — shell execution
    "code":      false,      //   Edit, Write, Read, NotebookEdit, Glob, Grep, LSP
    "subagents": false       //   Agent — token-heavy, isolated context
  },
  "mcps": [                  // external MCP servers — stdio, http, or sse
    {                        //   stdio (local subprocess; auth via env)
      "name": "github",
      "type": "stdio",       //   optional; "stdio" is the default
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env":  { "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}" },
      "allowed_tools": ["mcp__github"],
      "enabled": true
    },
    {                        //   http (remote server; auth via static headers)
      "name": "linear",
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${LINEAR_API_KEY}" },
      "allowed_tools": ["mcp__linear"],
      "enabled": true
    }
    // …Notion, Slack, Postgres, Playwright, your own — same shape; sse also supported
  ],
  "builtin_tools_disabled": [ // hamroh built-ins to hide from the agent
    // e.g. "telegram_create_poll", "telegram_stop_poll", "render_html", "render_latex", "telegram_send_photo"
  ],
  "skills_disabled": [       // skill directories under skills/ to hide
    // e.g. "render-style"
  ]
}
```

- **Tool groups.** Claude Code's dangerous built-ins (shell / code edit / subagents). All off by default. Flip to `true` and restart to unlock.
- **External MCPs.** Three transports supported, exactly as the [MCP spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) defines them: `stdio` (local subprocess, auth via `env`), `http` (remote streamable HTTP, auth via static `headers`), and `sse` (Server-Sent Events, same field shape as http). `${VAR}` references pull credentials from `.env`; if any required var is empty the MCP is silently skipped at boot. To stop advertising one without removing credentials, flip `"enabled": false`. Adding a new MCP (Linear, Notion, Slack, your own) is just a new array entry — no Python. Hamroh doesn't manage OAuth flows; supply an already-issued token via `${VAR}`.
- **Built-in tool toggles.** Names of hamroh built-ins (e.g. `telegram_create_poll`, `render_latex`) you want hidden. Filtered at MCP registration — the agent literally can't see them. A typo crashes boot with the available list.
- **Skill toggles.** Directory names under `skills/` to hide. The skill stays on disk but isn't listed or readable, so it can't be invoked.
