"""Value objects for the e2e suite: a conversation, a single bot turn, and the
eval scenario dataset.

A ``Scenario`` is one natural request the eval sends N times across DM and group
to measure correctness and latency. Prompts use natural phrasing (never "echo
this token") so the bot's prompt-injection defense stays out of the way.
``check`` decides how a reply counts as a pass:

* ``contains`` — the unique token appears in the reply text
* ``photo``    — the reply includes a photo
* ``any``      — any non-empty reply (used when we only time the path)
