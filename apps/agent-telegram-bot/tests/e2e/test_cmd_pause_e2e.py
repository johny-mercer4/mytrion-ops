"""E2E: /pause and /resume — owner-only message muting, DM and group.

Four scenarios, one per chat type:

paused → not processed   the owner sends /pause; a message in the target chat
                         gets no reply, never lands in the messages table, and
                         the bot stays alive (/health still answers PAUSED).
resumed → processed      after /resume a normal message is answered again, and
                         the prompt latency proves the CC session stayed warm.

Owner control commands (/pause, /resume, /health) are always issued in the owner
DM — group command addressing is quirky (see test_memory_e2e.py). The pause
applies to all chats, so the `target` conversation (where the drop / reply is
verified) is the DM for one test and the group for the other.
