"""E2E: the bot answers a real question correctly and promptly — DM and group.

The most basic guarantee: a message gets a correct, prompt response. A warm-up
turn pays the one-time startup cost off the clock, then the timed turn must both
answer correctly (return a unique token) and land its first chunk inside the
text-reply limit. The group case also exercises @mention delivery and group
authorization. (Aggregate p50/p95 across many samples lives in test_eval_e2e.py;
the bot subprocess is launched by the autouse fixture in conftest.)
