"""E2E: the latency + correctness eval runs as part of the suite.

The DM and group cases are separate tests (they fail and run independently).
Latency is reported, not gated: a single sample flakes near an SLO, so the
table is informational (raise ``E2E_EVAL_RUNS`` for trustworthy percentiles).
The correctness pass-rate over the matrix is the stable signal we assert.
A warm-up turn pays the one-time startup cost off the clock. Both tests reuse
the one session bot via ``hamroh_sut`` — no second bot is spawned.
