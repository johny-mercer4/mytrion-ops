"""E2E: the bot schedules reminders, fires them, and seeds committed ones.

scheduled (DM and group, separate tests): "remind me in 30 minutes: TOKEN"
    -> a pending reminders row lands with a ~30-minute trigger_at.
fires (DM and group, separate tests, @slow): "remind me in 70 seconds: TOKEN"
    -> the bot delivers an unsolicited message with TOKEN within ~2.5 min, and
    the row flips to sent.
committed (default-reminders.json): a reminder declared in the file is seeded
    at startup with a ``committed:`` auto_seed_key, and its recurring fire
    (@slow) delivers to the owner while the row stays pending (never sent).
