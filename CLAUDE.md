# CLAUDE.md — Octane Assistant working instructions

## Project identity

Octane internal AI assistant. TypeScript backend. Multi-tenant-lite (internal + partner audiences).
Borrows architecture patterns from Mytrion but is a clean, standalone codebase.

## Hard rules

1. Never import code from Mytrion. Reference structure only.
2. Every DB query goes through `repos/`. Repos enforce `tenant_id` isolation. No raw queries in `routes/`.
3. Every tool implements `ToolManifest`. No exceptions.
4. Every tool call passes through `toolDispatcher`, which re-checks RBAC.
5. File size cap: 600 lines, 580 target.
6. Strict TypeScript. No `any`. No `as unknown as X` without a comment justifying it.
7. Read-only is default. Write tools require `riskClass: 'write'` and admin role.
8. Every tool call is audit-logged.
9. Tests for RBAC cross-tenant leakage MUST pass before any feature work.

## Daily workflow

- Append a dated entry to `WORKING_NOTES.md` for each session.
- Run `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` before pushing.
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`.

## Build & tooling conventions (read before editing imports)

- **ESM + explicit extensions.** This is an ESM package (`"type": "module"`). Relative imports use
  explicit `.js` extensions (e.g. `import { x } from './foo.js'`) so the same source runs under
  `tsx` (dev), Vitest (test), and `node dist` (prod) without a path-rewrite step. Do **not** use the
  `@/*` path alias in source imports — it typechecks but does not resolve under `node dist`.
- **tsconfig split.** `tsconfig.json` is the typecheck/IDE config (no `rootDir`, includes tests +
  scripts). `tsconfig.build.json` is emit-only (`rootDir: ./src`, src only). `pnpm build` uses the
  build config.
- **pnpm via Corepack.** If `pnpm` isn't on PATH, use `corepack pnpm ...`.

## When in doubt

- Look at how Mytrion's `mytrion-engine` handles it (in another repo) — for pattern reference only.
- Ask in `WORKING_NOTES.md` before making architectural changes.
